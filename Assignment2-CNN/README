Q1)
ModelPart3 does not work but the others should work fine. 

Q2)
The convolution nueral network is better suited as a convolution allows the network to identify the shape of the three regardless of where it is in the image, whereas a feed-forward nueral network would only be able to identify the three if it was trained on images where the 3 was in the same relative space. 

Q3)

Q4)
a) 
The researchers claimed there were three features that contributed to criminality:
I)
The curvature of the upper lip, which is larger for criminals
II)
The distance between the inner corners of the eyes, which is shorter for criminals.
III)
The angle from the tip of the nose to the corners of the mouth, which is smaller for criminals.

b)
The algorithm found that non-criminals faces were relatively similar compared to the criminals who had more varience in their facial structures.
This could lead to grand generalisations made by the algorithm where someone who does not conform to the 'average' face of a non-criminal would (as a result) be defaulted into the criminal category. 

c)
This algorithm being used in law enforcement could cause massive ethical problems. Is it okay to arrest someone given a probability (even a high one) that they will commit a crime, or even place them in a managed form of monitering? This sort of outcome could be seen as a similar one to the getos used throughout history to detain the 'likely criminals' of the society and we have seen that branding an innocent person a criminal makes them more likle yot actually fall in with active criminals. 
Essentially another form of classism that can have no good outcome.
